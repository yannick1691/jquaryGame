# jquaryGame
A game made for scripting class on mediacollege amsterdam

The point of this very simple game is to show of some of my work and what i do
I also want to get better at javascript and jquery. And the best way to learn stuff is being doing it a 1000 times

Though published not all dependensies are uploaded because i do not own the right to distrubute all of the files to github.
so some mp3's will be missing also typed.js need to be downloaded by yourself
